vsutil ver 1.3

 The plugin vsutil.vim contains utility functions used by several of  my
 plugins.  I do think, however, they are much more generic than the  use
 they  were designed for and put to in these plugins.  I therefore  have
 put together this documentation for the potential user.
 At  present,  there  are  10  public functions  and  one  script  local
 function,  which  is accessed by a command.  There  are  also  2  other
 commands  related  to  this  one.  I  will  address  them  here  in  no
 particular  order  other than the order in which  they  appear  in  the
 plugin, which is completely irrelevant.



 
 IsVimNmr  returns Boolean 0 or 1 based on whether or not  its  argument
 variable’s content is wholly numeric.  Typically it is called in an  if
 statement:
      if IsVimNmr({numVar})
          Do something with number
 
 IsVimIdent returns Boolean 0 or 1 based on whether or not its  argument
 variable’s content conforms to Vim identifier convention.
      if IsVimIdent({identVar})
          Use the identifier
 
 IsVimVar  returns  Boolean –1 or 0 or 1 based on  whether  or  not  its
 argument  variable  is an identifier and if so,  does  it  exist.   The
 Boolean  is  –1  == valid, non-existent, 1 == valid, exist,  and  0  ==
 invalid.
      let g:foo=1
      function Foo(var)
          echo IsVimVar(a:var)
      endfunction
      call Foo(‘g:foo’)
      call Foo(‘foo’)
      call Foo(‘0defects’)
      
      1
      -1
      0
 
 IsStrLit returns Boolean zero or non-zero based on whether or  not  its
 argument  is  enclosed in matching quotes.  This is handy for  removing
 quotes  where they’re not wanted, adding them when they’re  wanted,  or
 telling whether or not you need to dereference.  If literal is enclosed
 in double quotes, 2 is returned, if in single quotes, 1 is returned.
 
 IsArryDecl, which probably doesn’t belong here, but here it is for  now
 at least, returns –1, 0, or 1.
 
 RGBtoHex  returns the hex of a 0-255 RGB value.  This  was  written  as
 part  of  a  response  to a posting and I’ve just kept  it  around  for
 general purposes.
 
 Next  comes  a  fairly useful pair of utilities that  are  based  on  a
 variation of strtok.  They are IsStrListTok and StrListTok.  The former
 returns  Boolean  based  on whether or not  its  argument  is  a  token
 separated  list  defined by the current token  delimiter.   The  latter
 parses  a  token separated list defined by the current token  delimiter
 and returns the next token.  Decision on the delimiter is as follows:
       ·    Optional argument to the function
       ·    Existence of a buffer variable (b:strListTokDelim)
       ·    Existence of a script variable (s:strListTokDelim)
       ·    Existence of a global variable (g:strListTokDelim)
       ·    Default of comma or newline
 
      if IsStrListTok(myList)
          let myTok=StrListTok(myList,’b:myList’)
          while myTok != ‘’
               Use token
              let myTok=StrListTok(‘’,’b:myList’)
          endwhile
          unlet b:myList
      endif
 
 The  above would parse a comma/newline separated list of tokens,  while
 the following would do the same with a colon separated list.
 
      if IsStrListTok(myList,’:’)
          let myTok=StrListTok(myList,’b:myList’,’:’)
          while myTok != ‘’
               Use token
              let myTok=StrListTok(‘’,’b:myList’)
          endwhile
          unlet b:myList
      endif
 
 QualifiedPath  decides if its argument is a fully qualified  path  file
 name  using  the  contents of the variable b:QPATH as a  pattern.   The
 default is '^\(\~\|\h:\|\\\|/\)'.
 
 FileParts is a lot like an MS/DOS C function I used once upon  a  time,
 but I can’t really remember the name of it.  Anyway, it takes its first
 argument, a qualified path or file name that can be expanded into  one,
 and  breaks  it down into its constituent parts.  It puts results  into
 any  ‘referenced’ variables you pass to it, empty references indicating
 no interest in the part.
      call FileParts(fname,’myFullName’,’myPathName’,’myName’,’myEx
                   t’)
      
 The  next  group consists of 3 commands and one script-local  function.
 It  is  for placing debug messages in code, which can be turned on  and
 off.  To start with, you need to execute the command SUDEBUGMSG to  set
 up  debugging  with  the  name of a parent script.   This  is  done  by
 executing  the  command outside of any function in the script  of  your
 choice.   Next,  in any scripts that make up the functionality  of  the
 parent  script and in the parent script itself you place debug commands
 of the form:
                           DEBUGMSG msg[,lvl]
      Where msg    is a string
                   lvl  is 0 for normal
                           1 for warning
                    > 1 for error
                        if not specified, 0 for normal
      echomsg format    <parent-script>::<functions(s)>: <message>
      displayed in black for normal
                        red for warning
                        reverse red for error
      
 
 Display  of the messages is toggled on and off by executing the command
 TGLDEBUGMSG.
 
 Pause() is a function that allows echo-ing of messages/information  and
 pausing to assure that they are seen.
                               Pause(msg)
 
 The  msg is displayed and the prompt ‘Press a key to continue’,  giving
 the user an opportunity to view the information.
 
 Sorting functions/commands from example by Robert Webb added.   See  :h
 eval-examples ‘Sorting lines (by Robert Webb)’ for details.
 
 Uniq() is a function that compares adjacent lines in a file and if they
 are equal, deletes one.
                         Uniq(strtline,endline)
 
 Substrmatch() is a function that compares 2 strings and finds the first
 longest occurrence of one in the other.
                   Substrmatch(str1,str2,offset,len,…)
 
 Str2 is searched for in str1, if found, the offset and len of the match
 are  placed  in  the  passed  variables.   If  optional  arguments  are
 specified they are the start of the search in str1 and str2.
 The passed offset variable contains –1 if no match is found
      
      let str1=”this matches, this matches, too.  You see, it
                   matches, too!”
      let str2=”matches, too”
      call Substrmatch(str1,str2,’b:offset’,’b:len’)
      echo “offset=”.b:offset.” len=”.b:len
      echo ”substr <”. strpart(str1,b:offset,b:len).”>”
      call Substrmatch(str1,str2,’b:offset’,’b:len’,b:offset+1)
      echo “offset=”.b:offset.” len=”.b:len
      echo ”substr <”. strpart(str1,b:offset,b:len).”>”
      let str1="this matches, and this matches.  You see, it
                   matches!"
      let str2="matches, too"
      call Substrmatch(str1,str2,'b:offset','b:len')
      echo "offset=".b:offset." len=".b:len
      echo "substr <".strpart(str1,b:offset,b:len).">"
      call Substrmatch(str1,str2,'b:offset','b:len',b:offset+1)
      echo "offset=".b:offset." len=".b:len
      echo "substr <".strpart(str1,b:offset,b:len).">"
      
      offset=19 len=12
      substr <matches, too>
      offset=46 len=12
      substr <matches, too>
      offset=5 len=9
      substr <matches, >
      offset=23 len=7
      substr <matches>
 
 RelativePath() is a function that finds the relative path of  one  file
 in the path of another.
                        RelativePath(path1,path2)
 
 The  longest common component of the 2 paths is found and the  path  of
 the  second  is  defined relative to that common path.   path1  may  be
 specified as either ‘.’ or ‘%’ for ‘current dir’ and ‘current file dir’
 respectively.
 
      let path2='c:/Vim/vimfiles/plugin/vsutil.vim'
      echo "Full-qualified file path <".path2.">"
      let path1='%'
      echo "Relative to <".path1."> [".expand('%:p')."]"
      echo "Relative Path <".RelativePath(path1,path2).">"
      let path1='.'
      echo "Relative to <".path1."> [".getcwd()."]"
      echo "Relative Path <".RelativePath(path1,path2).">"
      let path1='/Vim/vimfiles/plugin/array.vim'
      echo "Relative to <".path1.">"
      echo "Relative Path <".RelativePath(path1,path2).">"
      
      Full-qualified file path <c:/Vim/vimfiles/plugin/vsutil.vim>
      Relative to <%> [C:\Vim\vimfiles\testing\test2.vim]
      Relative Path <..\plugin\vsutil.vim>
      Relative to <.> [C:\Vim\vimfiles\plugin\example]
      Relative Path <..\vsutil.vim>
      Relative to </Vim/vimfiles/plugin/array.vim>
      Relative Path <.\vsutil.vim>
      
 ExpandDosEnvVar() is a function that expands environment  variables  of
 the form %VARNAME%.
              ExpandDosEnvVar(str[,remove_enclosing_quote])
 
 str  contains  DOS  style environment variables for expansion.   It  is
 returned  as  passed  except  that any %VARNAME%  is  expanded  to  its
 environment  value.  If the optional argument is included, opening  and
 closing  quote characters are removed, while any that are embedded  are
 retained.  If the variable value is not available in Vim’s environment,
 $VARNAME is returned.
 
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar("'%MuPAD_PRO_300%'")
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar("'%MuPAD_PRO_300%'",1)
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar('"%MuPAD_PRO_300%"')
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar('"%MuPAD_PRO_300%"',1)
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar('"%MuPAD_PRO_300% \"with embedded
                   quotes\""')
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar('"%MuPAD_PRO_300% \"with embedded
                   quotes\""',1)
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar("'%MuPAD_PRO_300% \"with embedded
                   quotes\"'")
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar("'%MuPAD_PRO_300% \"with embedded
                   quotes\"'",1)
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar('%MuPAD_PRO_300%')
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar('%MuPAD_PRO_300%',1)
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar("Microsoft's Platform SDK: %_PSDKLIB%
                   and %_PSDKLIB%\\IA64")
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar("Microsoft's Platform SDK: %_PSDKLIB%
                   and %_PSDKLIB%\\IA64",1)
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar("'%MuPAD_PRO_300% %NULLA%'")
      echo ExpandDosEnvVar("'%MuPAD_PRO_300% %NULLA%'",1)
